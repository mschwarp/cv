        <h3><em>Software & IT Professional</em></h3>
        <br>
        <p>I have a background in operations and customer care in an on-demand delivery app environment. I am currently pivoting into the IT space and have completed my CompTIA N+ (June 22) AWS Cloud Practioner Certifications (May 22), and AWS Solution
          Architect (August 22) certifications. Upon completion of the AWS Solution Architect, I came to the realization that I love building products and projects, so have moved my focus to become a Web Developer. Being a web developer allows for perfect
          synergy as my previous experience in operations alongside the certifications completed allows me to understand the tech flow from external and internal stakeholders' perspectives.</p>
